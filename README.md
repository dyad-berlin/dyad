# dyad

A small social platform for in-person conversations between strangers. A member writes a conversation prompt and suggests times and places. Another member responds, privately, once. The author picks one. They meet in person. Both reflect afterwards. No messaging between them; no feed; one response per prompt.

In alpha in Berlin. EU-hosted. Built toward steward ownership rather than VC.

## What this repository contains

The full source for `dyad.berlin` — frontend, server code, database migrations, and tests. Open source under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE). The platform's structural commitments and design rationale are in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md); the architecture and conventions for working in the codebase are in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md); contribution conventions are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Stack

SvelteKit, Svelte 5 (runes), Supabase (auth + Postgres + storage), TipTap (rich text), Leaflet (map), Cloudflare Pages.

The application identity layer goes through the [upact](https://github.com/prefig/upact) port — a typed contract that binds the application to architectural privacy minima regardless of which substrate handles authentication. Today the substrate is Supabase via [`@prefig/upact-supabase`](https://github.com/prefig/upact-supabase). The full architectural posture and the security tradeoffs of decoupling from the substrate are in `DESIGN.md` and `SECURITY.md`.

## Local development

```sh
npm install
npx supabase start          # local Supabase (Docker required)
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # fill in keys from `supabase start` output
npm run dev                  # Vite at localhost:5173
```

## Testing

```sh
npm test                     # unit tests (Vitest)
npm run test:integration     # integration tests (needs local Supabase running)
npx playwright test          # E2E tests (needs dev server + Supabase)
npx svelte-check --threshold error
```

The pre-commit hook runs secrets scanning, ESLint, svelte-check, and unit tests. The pre-push hook runs the E2E suite.

## Deployment

Deployed to Cloudflare Pages via `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare`. The admin plane lives at `admin.dyad.berlin` and is gated by Cloudflare Access — see `SECURITY.md` for the authentication model.

```sh
npx supabase db push         # push pending migrations to remote
npx supabase migration list  # compare local vs remote
```
