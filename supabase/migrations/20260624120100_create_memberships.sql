-- Membership entitlement — one row per actor, opaque-only, actor-keyed.
--
-- This table is dyad's entitlement store. It holds NO payment PII: no email,
-- name, address, card, or phone — only opaque Stripe references, a derived
-- `active` flag, and the cadence/source. Stripe is the data controller for
-- payment data (see /datenschutz); dyad keeps only what gating needs.
--
-- payment_ref is the ONLY dyad-side value ever sent to Stripe (as a Checkout
-- Session's client_reference_id and the subscription metadata). It is a random,
-- dyad-generated token — NOT the actor id (which is the Supabase substrate
-- UUID). This keeps dyad's master identifier out of Stripe's store and keeps
-- the upact identity port swappable: see the upact spec § "No identifiers
-- outside the contract". Operator-granted rows (comp/founding/grandfathered)
-- never touch Stripe, so their payment_ref stays NULL.
--
-- Writes are service-role only: members get SELECT on their own row (for the
-- /membership page and the gate check) but NO write grant, so a member can
-- never self-INSERT active=true. The REVOKE is explicit so a future stray
-- grant cannot reopen that hole (mirrors processed_stripe_events / app_settings).
