-- Add per-conversation capacity: the maximum number of joiners (accepted
-- meetings) allowed on any one time slot of the conversation.
--
--   NULL  = grandfathered "unlimited" — legacy rows published before this
--           shipped. New publishes must set a value (enforced in publish_prompt).
--   1     = one-on-one (a single accepted meeting per slot).
--   2..7  = small group (up to 8 people total including the author).
--
-- Capacity is set at first publish and is immutable thereafter (mirrors
-- audience_scope), so no edit path can leave a slot with more accepted
-- meetings than its capacity.
